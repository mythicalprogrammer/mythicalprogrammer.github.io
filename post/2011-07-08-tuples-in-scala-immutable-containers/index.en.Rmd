## What Are Tuples?  
Tuples are similar to lists but can contain multiple data types. They allow grouping of heterogeneous elements into a single value.  

### Creating a Tuple  

```scala
val randomCollection = (1985, "clown", "rubber chicken", 12, "dove", 'c')
```

**Note:**  
The Scala compiler infers the data types of each element automatically:  
- `1985` is an `Int`  
- `"clown"` is a `String`  
- `'c'` is a `Char`  

## Accessing Tuple Elements  

To retrieve elements from a tuple, use `._` followed by the index (starting at **1**).  

```scala
println(randomCollection._1) // Outputs: 1985
println(randomCollection._2) // Outputs: clown
```

**Important:** Unlike lists or arrays (which use zero-based indexing), tuples in Scala are **one-based indexed** when accessing elements.
