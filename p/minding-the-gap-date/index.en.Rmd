## Introduction

In this post, we explore the concept of **gaps** in sequential data and how **Window Functions** can be leveraged to identify and analyze them effectively.

## Refresher on Window Functions

**Window Functions** were introduced in [ANSI SQL:2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2003). These functions allow computations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row using the `OVER` clause.

A common use case for window functions is analytical queries, particularly in identifying **islands and gaps** in datasets:

- **Islands**: Groups of **continuous** data sequences.
- **Gaps**: **Missing** sequences between data points.

## Problem Scenario

Consider a scenario where a patient enrolled in a health program is required to check in daily. Our objective is to identify the **gaps** in their consecutive visits.

## Dataset

### Sample Data

| visit_date |
|------------|
| 2025-02-02 |
| 2025-02-03 |
| 2025-02-11 |
| 2025-02-12 |
| 2025-02-13 |
| 2025-02-27 |
| 2025-04-03 |
| 2025-04-04 |
| 2025-04-05 |
| 2025-05-12 |

### Creating the Dataset in SQL

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #table2;

CREATE TABLE #table2(visit_date DATE);

INSERT INTO #table2 (visit_date)
VALUES
    ('2025-02-02'),
    ('2025-02-03'),
    ('2025-02-11'),
    ('2025-02-12'),
    ('2025-02-13'),
    ('2025-02-27'),
    ('2025-04-03'),
    ('2025-04-04'),
    ('2025-04-05'),
    ('2025-05-12');
```

## Expected Output

After analyzing gaps, we should obtain the following missing date ranges:

| start_range | end_range |
|------------|----------|
| 2025-02-04 | 2025-02-10 |
| 2025-02-14 | 2025-02-26 |
| 2025-02-28 | 2025-04-02 |
| 2025-04-06 | 2025-05-11 |

## Algorithmic Approach

To identify gaps, we calculate the difference in days between each visit. If the gap is greater than one day, it indicates a missing period.

### Step 1: Compare Each Visit to the Next

| current_visit | next_visit |
|--------------|-----------|
| 2025-02-02  | 2025-02-03 |
| 2025-02-03  | 2025-02-11 |
| 2025-02-11  | 2025-02-12 |
| 2025-02-12  | 2025-02-13 |
| 2025-02-13  | 2025-02-27 |
| 2025-02-27  | 2025-04-03 |
| 2025-04-03  | 2025-04-04 |
| 2025-04-04  | 2025-04-05 |
| 2025-04-05  | 2025-05-12 |
| 2025-05-12  | NULL |

### Step 2: Compute Days Between Visits

| current_visit | next_visit | days_between |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025-02-02  | 2025-02-03 | 1 |
| 2025-02-03  | 2025-02-11 | 8 |
| 2025-02-11  | 2025-02-12 | 1 |
| 2025-02-12  | 2025-02-13 | 1 |
| 2025-02-13  | 2025-02-27 | 14 |
| 2025-02-27  | 2025-04-03 | 35 |
| 2025-04-03  | 2025-04-04 | 1 |
| 2025-04-04  | 2025-04-05 | 1 |
| 2025-04-05  | 2025-05-12 | 37 |
| 2025-05-12  | NULL | NULL |

Any difference greater than **1 day** represents a gap.

## SQL Implementation

We use the **LEAD Window Function** to fetch the next visit date for comparison.

```sql
SELECT visit_date AS startDate,
       LEAD(visit_date) OVER (ORDER BY visit_date) AS endDate
FROM #table2;
```

### Output

| startDate | endDate |
|-----------|---------|
| 2025-02-02 | 2025-02-03 |
| 2025-02-03 | 2025-02-11 |
| 2025-02-11 | 2025-02-12 |
| 2025-02-12 | 2025-02-13 |
| 2025-02-13 | 2025-02-27 |
| 2025-02-27 | 2025-04-03 |
| 2025-04-03 | 2025-04-04 |
| 2025-04-04 | 2025-04-05 |
| 2025-04-05 | 2025-05-12 |
| 2025-05-12 | NULL |

## Final Query

The final query identifies gaps by filtering where the difference is greater than 1 day:

```sql
WITH CTE_LEAD AS (
    SELECT visit_date AS startDate,
           LEAD(visit_date) OVER (ORDER BY visit_date) AS endDate
    FROM #table2
)
SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 1, startDate) AS startDate,
       DATEADD(DAY, -1, endDate) AS endDate
FROM CTE_LEAD
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, startDate, endDate) > 1;
```

## Explanation

- The **CTE_LEAD** common table expression fetches the next visit date.
- The outer query filters out rows where the gap is more than one day.
- The `DATEADD()` function adjusts the start and end dates to reflect the missing range.

### Final Output

| startDate  | endDate |
|------------|---------|
| 2025-02-04 | 2025-02-10 |
| 2025-02-14 | 2025-02-26 |
| 2025-02-28 | 2025-04-02 |
| 2025-04-06 | 2025-05-11 |

## Conclusion

This post demonstrated how **Window Functions** help identify gaps in sequential data efficiently, making them a powerful tool for analytical SQL queries.
