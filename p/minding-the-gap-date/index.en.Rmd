LEAD win fn: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/lead-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16

Quote:
Again, with LEAD, the code is much more intuitive and human readable. Here, we are just checking range between consecutive dates and if it’s greater than 1, that means that we have a gap in our sequence. When that criteria is met, we are just adding one day to last “island” date in the sequence to get first “gap” date, while subtracting one from the first “island” date in next sequence to get the last date of the “gap”.


## Code

```SQL

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #table2
;

CREATE TABLE #table2(visit_date date);


INSERT INTO #table2(visit_date)
VALUES
('2025-02-02'),
('2025-02-03'),
('2025-02-11'),
('2025-02-12'),
('2025-02-13'),
('2025-02-27'),
('2025-04-03'),
('2025-04-04'),
('2025-04-05'),
('2025-05-12')
;


SELECT *
FROM #table2
ORDER BY visit_date
;

WITH CTE_LEAD AS
(
SELECT visit_date AS startDate
	, LEAD(visit_date) OVER(ORDER BY visit_date) AS endDate
FROM #table2
)
SELECT DATEADD(dd, 1, startDate) AS startDate
	,DATEADD(dd, -1, endDate) endDate
FROM CTE_LEAD
WHERE DATEDIFF(dd, startDate, endDate) > 1
;
```
