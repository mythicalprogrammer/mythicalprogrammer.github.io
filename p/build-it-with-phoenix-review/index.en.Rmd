## Introduction

I bought, ["Build It with Phoenix" by Geoffrey Lessel](builditwithphoenix.com) on 2023-08-2023 on sale.

I didn't start on this until 2024-11-17 and finished it 2024-12-04.

It's a program with videos and github codes to teach Phoenix and liveview.

## Outline

### Pros

* Teaches and goes into the mindset of how to debug
* How to read the document
* How Phoenix Auth generator works and how to use it
* How to upkeep a Phoenix project (Elixir in general too)

### Cons

* Not in depth about liveview and Phoenix.
* A tad outdated still workable (`phx-update="append"`)

## Pros

### Teaches and goes into the mindset of how to debug

* `iex`
* ecto debug with `iex`
* how to read error message and track down the line of codes that's causing it
* `IO.inspect`

### How to upkeep a Phoenix project (Elixir in general too)

* `mix hex.outdated`
* `mix hex.clean --all`
* `mix hex.update --all`
* `mix clean`
* `mix compile`

### Cons

It's not as in depth as, ["Real-Time Phoenix" by Stephen Bussey](https://pragprog.com/titles/sbsockets/real-time-phoenix/).

## Conclusion

Overall, a great introduction to Phoenix. I have a decent amount of experience 
of Phoenix, but I learned quite a bit.

The biggest thing I like was how to think about context.

It gave me a gentle introduction to liveview.

It's a good first step into Phoenix and liveview and would recommend it.

It's a bit tad expensive though at $129. 

I hope Geo will update it with liveview version 1.0.
