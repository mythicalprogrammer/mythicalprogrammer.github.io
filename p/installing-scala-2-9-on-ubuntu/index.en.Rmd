**NOTE:**
This is a very old post that I've migrated from my blogger account.

I have matured since then and continue to learn, striving to remain humble with a mindset of humility.

# Installing Scala 2.9 on Ubuntu  

## Steps to Install Scala (Latest Version as of Writing: 2.9)  

### 1. Download Scala  
Open your browser and go to the [Scala downloads page](http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads).  

Find the appropriate package for **Unix, Mac OS X, or Cygwin**, and either download it manually or copy the direct link to the package.  

### 2. Open Terminal & Navigate to Root  
```bash
cd /
```  

### 3. Create `/opt` Directory (If It Doesn't Exist)  
Ubuntu does not include an `/opt` directory by default, so create one manually:  
```bash
sudo mkdir /opt  
```

### 4. Navigate to `/opt`  
```bash
cd /opt  
```

### 5. Download Scala  
Replace the version number with the latest available if necessary:  
```bash
sudo wget http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads/distrib/files/scala-2.9.0.1.tgz  
```

### 6. Extract the Package  
```bash
sudo tar zxvf scala-2.9.0.1.tgz  
```

### 7. Remove the Archive File  
```bash
sudo rm scala-2.9.0.1.tgz  
```

### 8. Add Scala to Your PATH  
Edit your `~/.bashrc` file to include Scalaâ€™s binary path:  
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc  
```
Add the following line at the end of the file:  
```bash
export PATH=/opt/scala-2.9.0.1/bin:$PATH  
```

### 9. Apply the Changes  
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  
```
