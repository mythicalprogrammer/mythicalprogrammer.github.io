**Note:** This post was created awhile back on another platform (Tumblr) and I migrated to my current one.

## **Array Initialization**  

### **Using `new Array` Constructor**  

```scala
val arrayOfStrings = new Arrayrings(0) = "Hi"
arrayOfStrings(1) = " array"
arrayOfStrings(2) = " of Strings.\n"
```

### **Using `Array` Factory Method**  

```scala
val arrayOfStrings = Array("Hi", " array", " of Strings.\n")
```

## **Printing Array Elements**  

```scala
for (i <- 0 to 2)
  print(arrayOfStrings(i))
```

### **Output:**  
```
Hi array of Strings.
```

## **Understanding `val` and Mutability**  

Although `val` makes a variable immutable, it does not make the contents of an array immutable. You **cannot reassign** `arrayOfStrings` to a new array, but you **can** modify its elements:  

```scala
arrayOfStrings(0) = "Bye"
for (i <- 0 to 2)
  print(arrayOfStrings(i))
```

### **Output:**  
```
Bye array of Strings.
```

## **Why Does This Happen?**  

Even though `val` prevents reassignment of the **variable**, it does not make the object it points to immutable. The array itself remains **mutable**, meaning its elements can be modified. However, you **cannot** assign `arrayOfStrings` to a completely new array.
