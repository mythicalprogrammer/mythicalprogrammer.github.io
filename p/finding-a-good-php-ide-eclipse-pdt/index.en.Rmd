**Note:** This post was created awhile back on another platform and I migrated to my current one.

So after using Dreamweaver CS3 for a couple of months now, I felt it was lacking. It wasn't as good as Microsoft Visual Studio. One of the things it's lacking is a good auto-complete. The way Dreamweaver CS3 handles most of the coding is annoying and not as natural as Microsoft Visual Studio.

I've googled a bit and found out about Eclipse IDE with PDT. So far, it's a great IDE. I do not know all about it but just enough through these videos:

**Note:** Code Assist is not on by default, so you need to go to:  
`Window -> Preferences -> PHP -> Code Assist`  
Check the **"Enabled auto activation"** checkbox. The default 200 ms delay is long, so I edited it to 20 ms.
