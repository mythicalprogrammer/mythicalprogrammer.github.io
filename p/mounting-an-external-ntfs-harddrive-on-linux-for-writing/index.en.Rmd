### **Mounting an External Hard Drive on Linux**

If you have an external hard drive formatted with **FAT32** or **FAT16**, you can both read and write to it without issues.

However, if your hard drive uses the **NTFS** file system, you will encounter **read-only access** by default. This is due to **FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) legal restrictions** preventing full NTFS write support. The constant **"Read-only file system"** warning can be frustrating!

### **Solution: Enabling NTFS Write Support**
The solution is to use `ntfs-3g`, which allows writing to NTFS partitions. Here's a quick summary:

1. **Install `ntfs-3g`**  
   Search for and install the `ntfs-3g` package using your package manager.  
   Example for Debian/Ubuntu:  
   ```sh
   sudo apt install ntfs-3g
   ```
   
2. **Create a Mount Directory**  
   Before mounting, create a directory to serve as the mount point.  
   Example:  
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /mnt/window
   ```

3. **Find Your External Hard Drive Name**  
   Use `fdisk` to list available drives and find your external drive based on size:  
   ```sh
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```
   If youâ€™re using a **USB drive**, it is likely to be **`/dev/sdb`**.

4. **Edit `/etc/fstab` to Mount Automatically**  
   Open the file in a text editor:  
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```
   Add the following line:  
   ```
   /dev/sdb1  /mnt/window  ntfs-3g  defaults  0  0
   ```

5. **Mount the Drive**  
   Run the mount command to apply changes:  
   ```sh
   sudo mount -a
   ```
