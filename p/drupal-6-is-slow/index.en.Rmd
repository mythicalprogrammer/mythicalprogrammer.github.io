## Drupal 6 Performance Issues and Optimization  

Drupal 6 is incredibly slow right now. Adam and I just installed a lot of modules and enabled them.  

### Setup  
*Debian 5 with Apache 2*  

### 1st Assumption: Database  
Accessing the database could be the reason for the slowdown. Checking the MySQL logs (`/var/log`) reveals nothingâ€”perhaps I didnâ€™t enable logging. Iâ€™ll check on that later.  

### 2nd Assumption: Modules  
Let's disable all the modules! This helped just a little. During this process, I also disabled all caching options in Drupal.  

### A Surprising Discovery  
After taking a day-long break, I checked the website again, and it was fast! However, when clicking on the administration URL, it was still very slow. Here's what I found on the Drupal support forum:  

> *"The admin pages in Drupal 6 are slow because they perform a lot of housekeeping and rebuilding (thousands of queries, as you noticed, and these are not just cosmetic). Caching probably wonâ€™t help with that.*  
>  
> *If it is unworkable, disabling the update status module will probably help a bit. There are open issues for reducing the number of queries in future updates, but donâ€™t expect the D6 admin pages to become snappy. They take the hit for some tasks that make the user part of the site more reliable.*

> *About the normal site pages... the usual optimization methods should apply."*

### Optimization Steps  
Alright, letâ€™s optimize the webpage.  

#### Installed Tools:  
- [Life-of-Request Info extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&category=Developer%20Tools&numpg=10&id=1743)  
- [Devel module](http://drupal.org/project/devel) (Where is this log file?)  

#### 1st Optimization: PHP Optimization with APC  
I installed the **APC** package for PHP (read about it [here](http://pecl.php.net/package/APC)).  
Hereâ€™s a tutorial on using **APC**:  
[APC on Debian Lenny](http://www.easywebdns.com/tutorials/Linux/php/APC_ON_DEBIAN_LENNY)  

#### Performance Results:  
**Accessing main Drupal as webmaster:**  
- 1st try: **1.3s**  
- 2nd try (browser cache cleared): **0.661s**  
- 3rd try: **0.877s**  

**As a non-user:**  
- **0.536s**  

### Enabling All Modules  
- **Main page:** **1.114s - 1.124s**  
- **Content-generated pages:** ~**0.224s**, at most **< 0.5s** (no images, just text)  

**Yay, itâ€™s faster!** ðŸš€
