## Current Webstack 2023

### [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/)

I enjoy the programming language. It's fun and it's mostly complete as quoted by Jose Valim (the creator of Elixir). 

There are mostly improvements for developers like debugging and bug fixes.

Jose Valim have been working hard and in a few years or so maybe we get type in Elixir. It's not guarantee but he have been talking about his work.

One thing is there are like [three version managers](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) for managing Elixir and Erlang versions now.


* [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) - install and manage different [Elixir](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir) and [Erlang](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang) versions
* [kiex](https://github.com/taylor/kiex) - install and manage different Elixir versions
* [kerl](https://github.com/yrashk/kerl) - install and manage different Erlang versions


### [Phoenix Framework](https://phoenixframework.org/)

It's getting better.

Deployment is `mix release` [1](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.15/Mix.Tasks.Release.html) instead of using [edeliver](https://github.com/edeliver/edeliver). 

The framework have [built in log-in](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/mix_phx_gen_auth.html) now. Back then there were so many third party log-in options. It was hectic just trying to figure it out and integrate it.




### [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_overview)


Just plain vanilla Javascript. I am not really into front end as much and don't have much time for it. Been doing a lot of statistic, data science, and machine learning stuff.



### [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

I'm going to stick with what I know. End users doesn't care about the tech you use. It works and I'd like to quickly bring up a project.

### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Same reason as above.

### [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

PostgreSQL is still my favorite RMDB.

### Linux ([Debian](https://www.debian.org/))

Debian is rock solid as a server OS. It's either this or Ubuntu. It doesn't matter much for me.

### IDE
#### [VIM](https://www.vim.org/) & [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)

These two in tandem is my go to for web development. 

## Future

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

I'd like to move to Tailwind CSS. They already name all the things you need and you don't have to come up with any. It may looks ugly html but I don't mind it. I don't mind html tag having tons of classes.

It also remove zombie classes too. Zombie classes are classes that are defined but not used.

### [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)

Can reduce Javascript codes. I'd like to use as little javascript as possible and more Elixir instead.

It's not 1.0 yet and even then it's probably not perfect. I'll play around just to stay ahead and keep a general idea where it's going.

### IDE

#### [VS Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

It's a good IDE for tailwind css integration (autocomplete and suggestions).

### [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

Manage server and back end for me. Less system admin tasks eating my time and it'll let me concentrate on iterating and getting the project out.

## Summary

At the end of the day, I am tired of trying to get the ideal tech stack and get everything perfect.

I just want to have a product out. 

Get people to use it and iterate the product.

Once and if the product is flesh out then I'll worry about perfection.

At this point my mindset is my code will be toss out within 5 years for a rewrite either adopting a new tech or update. So don't worry about perfection.
