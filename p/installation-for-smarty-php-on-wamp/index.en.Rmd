**Note:** This post was created awhile back on another platform and I migrated to my current one.

I got this from here: [http://news.php.net/php.smarty.dev/2703](http://news.php.net/php.smarty.dev/2703)

## Steps to Install Smarty:

### 1. Download [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/download.php)

### 2. Extract Smarty
Extract it **outside** of the `www` folder (e.g., `C:\wamp`).  
Rename the `Smarty.x.x.x` folder to `smarty`.

### 3. Edit `php.ini`
To do this, left-click on the WAMP icon in the system tray, under the **PHP** menu, there should be a `php.ini` option.

Example configuration:
```ini
include_path = ".;C:\wamp\smarty\libs"
```
**WARNING:** Copy-pasting might create errors with single and double quotes. Make sure to type them manually.

### 4. Restart All Services
Click on the WAMP icon in the system tray and select **Restart All Services**.

### 5. Create Required Folders
In your root `www` folder, create a directory named `smarty`, and within that folder, create:  
- `templates`
- `configs`

Outside of `www`, within `C:/wamp/smarty`, create:  
- `templates_c`
- `cache`

**Note:** There are security concerns for live setups, but for localhost, this is fine. Always use Linux for live testing.

### 6. Create an HTML File
Inside `www` or any subfolder within `www`, create a file (e.g., `index.html`).

### 7. Create the Template File
Create `index.tpl` and place it inside `www/smarty/templates`.
