**Note:** This post was created awhile back on another platform and I migrated to my current one.

![Daylight Saving Time Costs Billions](http://www.treehugger.com/daylight-saving-time-costs-billions.jpg)

Needed to change the timezone on a server to match our client.

Run this command:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
```

And it'll bring up a GUI-like command line interface where you can select options using the space bar, tab through choices, and press enter to confirm. Real simple.
