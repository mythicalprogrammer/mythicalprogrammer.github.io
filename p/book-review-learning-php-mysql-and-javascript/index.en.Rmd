**Note:** This post was created awhile back on another platform and I migrated to my current one.

Note I've matured now and have decided to not post any books I do not like. I apologize in advance for my negative review of this book and I did not intend to be overly negative. I was young and am still learning.

The post:

# Learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript  
*A Step-By-Step Guide to Creating Dynamic Websites (Animal Guide)*

## **My Review**
I needed to **review PHP** since many things have changed. I first tried *Head First PHP & MySQL*, but it wasn‚Äôt technical enough for me. While I initially thought its teaching style would help, it didn‚Äôt work out.  

This book assumes **some programming knowledge**, which is great because it moves at a faster pace. Unlike *Head First PHP & MySQL*, which is slow, this book goes straight to the key subjects‚Äî**PHP, MySQL**, and even touches on other topics. However, when I reached the **JavaScript section**, I stopped reading.

## **Pros & Cons**  

### **‚úÖ What I Liked**
- **Fast-paced** if you already know some programming.  
- **Great MySQL chapters** ‚Äì I learned about MySQL database engines like **InnoDB** and **ISAM** and how to **search databases like a search engine**.  
- **Good for PHP basics** ‚Äì helped me **dive back into PHP** and solidify the fundamentals of PHP5.  

### **‚ùå What I Didn't Like**
- **Too many code errors** ‚Äì you can find them listed [here](http://oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=9780596157142).  
- **Confusing examples** ‚Äì Some techniques shouldn't even be used in real-world applications.  
- **PHP authentication example is flawed** ‚Äì The book combines **HTTP authentication with PHP sessions**, but doesn't explain **how to log out properly**. Deleting browser cookies doesn‚Äôt work, and I had to **Google better solutions** (hint: use a **logout flag** in the script).  
- **Smarty introduction is weak** ‚Äì Installation instructions were unclear, which is why I wrote a [separate guide](http://yourallstar.blogspot.com/2010/05/installation-for-smarty-php-on-wamp.html) for Windows XP.  
- **No Object-Oriented PHP** ‚Äì All PHP examples are **procedural**, with no coverage of **OOP** in PHP5.  
- **Terrible JavaScript section** ‚Äì The JavaScript coding style is **ugly**, doesn‚Äôt follow **best practices**, and lacks proper **variable declarations (`var variable1`) and semicolons**. A better **beginner JavaScript book** would be a wiser choice (I'll post a review of one soon).

## **Final Verdict**  
This book is a **basic introduction to PHP** for those with a programming background. However, it **does not cover Object-Oriented PHP5 at all**.  

I‚Äôd rate it **‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è (3/5 stars)** because it helped me **refresh my PHP knowledge**, but I **wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying it**‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre looking for advanced topics or modern best practices.  

üìå **Warning:** I only read **up to Chapter 16** (out of 20). I stopped when I reached **JavaScript**.  

Oh, and if you **click the image and buy it from Amazon**, I get some store credit for more books‚Äîbut honestly, **this isn‚Äôt worth buying**. üòâ
