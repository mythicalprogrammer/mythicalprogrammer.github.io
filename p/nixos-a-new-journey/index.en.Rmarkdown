Note: Draft, I'm not sure when I will get back to this.

## Introducation

This story happened a long time ago, 2 days ago, in a galaxy far, far away. It is already over. Nothing can be done to change it. It is a story of frustration and love for a crazy operating system on a lost technology laptop [Thinkpad T400](https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T400). 

## Installation

Installation on 32 bit

https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation

## Filesystem Chosen (BTRFS)

Youtube overview on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwNg_fusT9A

### FS questions

1. What are subvolumes in BTRFS?
2. What software/apps is recommended for BTRFS? (Esp. Defrag. Look at OpenSUSE app)
3. How large my /swap be if I have 64 GB of RAM?

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-swapspace

At least 4GB.

https://superuser.com/questions/777907/swap-partition-size-on-a-64-gb-ram-computer-for-memory-intensive-work

16GB

4. What's Impermanence means in NixOS?

https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-does-impermanence-add-over-built-in-functionality/27939

"The idea of impermanence is that upon reboot, the machine loses its state and in the case of NixOS gets recreated from your configuration (stored in a persistent area of your file system). So any erroneous state changes (accidental or otherwise) are lost between reboots.
The persistent area will hold some important data - perhaps ssh keys (depending on type) and passwords that you may need beyond your configuration.nix (or flake)
It does not affect your home folders.
I found Guekkaâ€™s blog are good resource - [NixOS as a server, part 1: Impermanence | Guekka's blog](https://guekka.github.io/nixos-server-1/)
I use it - as much to find out more about it as anything else.
If it interests you, try on a spare machine first."
