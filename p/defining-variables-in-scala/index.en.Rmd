**NOTE:**
This is a very old post that I've migrated from my tumblr account.

I have matured since then and continue to learn, striving to remain humble with a mindset of humility.

# Defining Variables in Scala  

## Two Types of Variables  

- `val` (immutable)  
- `var` (mutable)  

## Example: Immutable `val`  

```scala
val hello = "Hello Scala"
hello = "Hello again" // ERROR: can only assign once
println(hello)
```

> Note: `val` is **not** the same as `const` in C++. *(See: Java `final` vs. C++ `const`.)*  

## Example: Mutable `var`  

```scala
var goodbye = "Hello Scala"
goodbye = "Goodbye Scala"
println(goodbye)
```
