**Note:** This post was created awhile back on another platform and I migrated to my current one.

So my landlord computer is shot so he wants the file. Problem is his filesystem is dead, his master boot record is shot to death beyond mountable. So what to do...<br /><br />You do this:<br />http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/420<br /><br />It didn't work so I did PhotoRec which is cover in the above link and retrieve files. It took 160 passes and it still didn't finish so I just grab what it retrieved.
