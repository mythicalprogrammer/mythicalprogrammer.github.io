## Introduction

This week I had to study for a job interview at a pretty sweet place. So in preparation for it I’ve read up on statistics that I’ve listed on my resume. I’ve came across a few good papers and I’m just happy to have read it. Just wanted to post it here in case if I ever need a refresher on Bayesian.

## Basic Master Level Statistic

Introductory Mathematical Statistics Methods of Estimation and Properties of Point Estimators: Fundamental Exercises with Solutions by Dr. Olga Korosteleva

This is written by my professor and it was in a neat package of overview of what I’ve learned in my master program. It is a good refresher. There were some notes I’ve written for clarifications:

<ul>
<li>
  MLE - This selects the parameter values that make the data most probable
</li>
<li>
    Likelihood (frequentist point of view) - is a function of the parameters of a statistical model, given specific observed data.
</li>
<li>
    Method of Moments Estimators (MOM) & MLE are two estimator methods to do point estimation for parameter. This is the frequentist point of view on estimating parameters which are fixed. Where as Bayesian model parameter as a random variable and not a fixed point.
</li>
<li>
    Fisher information - is a way of measuring the amount of information that an observable random variable X carries about an unknown parameter theta of a distribution models X.
</li>
<li>
    Cramer-Rao Lower Bound - expresses a lower-bound on the variance of unbiased estimators of a deterministic parameter. An unbiased estimator which achieves this lower bound is efficient.
</li>
<li>
    Sufficient Statistic - a statistic that summarize all of the information in a sample about the desired parameter. (Penn State have more clarification on this).
</li>
</ul>

## Bayesian Review

[On Bayesian Data Analysis by Christian P. Robert and Judith Rousseau (August 27, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4656)

Point estimation parameter vs parameter with distribution. Credible Interval vs Confidence Interval. Critiques of Bayesian and solutions.

*An Introduction to Bayesian Statistics Without Using Equations by Tomoharu Eguchi (2008)*

Great visualization take on how to explain Bayesian Statistic.

[A tutorial on Bayesian nonparametric models by Samuel J. Gershman and David M. Blei (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2697)

A review what I used during my time at the FDA.
