### Predictive Model for Detecting Toxicity in Drugs

FDA - Food & Drug Administration - National Center Toxicological Research 2017

Implemented non-parametric Bayesian hierarchical model using Chinese restaurant process in R to predict drug induced liver injuries (DILI). This model was going to be use to predict new and old drugs on the market to see if there is a possibility of toxicity base on other known drugs with similar chemical profile. Nonparametric Bayesian is used is used so that the model can extend to multiple data sources, beyond DILI, to make prediction.
